# CNAPP - Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms

CNAPP stands for **Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform**. It is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications throughout their entire lifecycle, from development to deployment and runtime. CNAPPs aim to provide a comprehensive, integrated approach to securing modern applications that are built using microservices, containers, serverless functions, and other cloud-native technologies.

## Key Features of CNAPPs:

1. **Workload Protection**: Secures cloud workloads such as containers, virtual machines (VMs), and serverless functions.
2. **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Helps manage and improve the security posture of cloud environments by identifying and remediating misconfigurations.
3. **DevSecOps Integration**: Ensures that security is integrated into the DevOps pipeline, providing automated security checks during development.
4. **Runtime Protection**: Monitors and protects applications during runtime to detect and respond to threats or vulnerabilities.
5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Security**: Enforces security policies related to access controls and permissions within cloud environments.
6. **API Security**: Monitors and secures APIs, which are crucial for communication between services in cloud-native architectures.

CNAPPs aim to provide unified security across multiple cloud environments, ensuring that cloud-native applications are both developed securely and remain protected in production.
